# Martingale

A minimal repository containing examples, including a Streamlit app to price European options using the Black-Scholes formula.

## Black-Scholes Streamlit App

Run the app with:

```bash
streamlit run black_scholes_app.py
```

The app lets you input the underlying price, strike, time to maturity, risk-free rate and volatility, then displays the corresponding call or put option price.

It also shows a line chart preview of option prices across a range of underlying values.
